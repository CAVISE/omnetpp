%description:
Check detection of unused inifile entries.

Common causes of an entry being unused are:
1. Mistyped or otherwise bogus key -- this is the type we primarily want to detect and report
2. Accidental shadowing by another entry -- to be reported too
3. Intentional shadowing (i.e. override) from a derived section
4. Parameter is to be used by a future (dynamically created) module
5. Per-object config options that refer to result names are not used until a matching result is recorded
6. Some config options like "description", "extends" or "repeat" are not consumed via cConfiguration


%file: test.ned
network TestNet {
    parameters:
       int override;
       int override2;
       int dupl;
       int fixed = 3;
}

%inifile: test.ini
[General]
network = TestNet  # NOTE: this shadows the one in [General] of _defaults.ini, so it will be reported as duplicate within section
network = Foo  # duplicated within section
**.override = -1  # to be overridden in [Hello]
**.override2 = -1  # to be overridden in [Hello]

[Hello]
description = "Test config"
extends = General  # redundant, only here for test's sake
repeat = 1  # redundant, only here for test's sake
repeat = 1  # duplicated within section
**.fixed = -1      # parameter already set in NED file
**.mistyuped = -1  # mistyped parameter

**.override = 999  # takes effect
**.override* = 999 # overrides override2

**.dupl = 111  # 1st of duplicated
**.dupl = 222  # 2nd of duplicated
**.du* = 333   # 3rd of duplicated, using wildcard

**.bogus.vector-recording-intervals = 0..1000s # no such output vector, but not reported since we're just after network setup (such entries would only be used later)

%extraargs: -c Hello

%contains: stdout
Note: There were unused entries in the configuration after network setup:
  repeat = 1  # duplicated within section  (from test.ini:11, section [Hello])
  **.fixed = -1  # parameter already set in NED file  (from test.ini:12, section [Hello])
  **.mistyuped = -1  # mistyped parameter  (from test.ini:13, section [Hello])
  **.dupl = 222  # 2nd of duplicated  (from test.ini:19, section [Hello])
  **.du* = 333  # 3rd of duplicated, using wildcard  (from test.ini:20, section [Hello])
  network = Foo  # duplicated within section  (from test.ini:3, section [General])
  network = Test  (from _defaults.ini:3, section [General])
