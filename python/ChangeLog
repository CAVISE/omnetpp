	* omnetpp.scave.utils: Add digit grouping to tick labels in MPL-emulated
	native charts.

2021-10-26  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.utils: Make MPL-emulated native widgets more similar
	to the IDE (axis limits, number format for ticks, etc.)

2021-10-15  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.plot: Restore the omnetpp.scave.plot module for
	compatibility. It falls back to the new omnetpp.scave.ideplot package
	after issuing a warning.

2021-10-11  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.utils: assert_columns_exist() to raise ValueError from
	instead of calling exit() (which a library is not supposed to do).

2021-10-07  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.utils: plot_bars(), plot_vectors(), plot_histograms(): Sort
	results by legend label (or indices, for bar charts) before plotting.

2021-10-07  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.utils: Fix: Make legend options work again with non-native charts

2021-10-05  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Rename omnetpp.scave.plot module to omnetpp.scave.ideplot,
	because it better describes its functionality (accessing native plots in the
	IDE).

2021-10-04  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Refactoring: Rename internal package impl_charttool to
	impl, and all modules in it appropriately

2021-10-04  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.results: Remove the `merge_module_and_name` parameter

2021-09-27  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.results: added support for direct loading of result files
	into a dataframe (read_result_files()), and extended query functions so they
	accept that dataframe as input.

2021-07-27  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.vectorops: Fix example code and docs for crop(), don't try
	to perform movingavg() in-place

2021-06-14  Levente Meszaros, Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: added timewinthruput vector operation

2021-04-20  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Vector operations are now registered using the
	@vector_operation decorator
