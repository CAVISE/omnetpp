  OMNeT++ 6.0rc1 (Feb 2022)
  -------------------------
  
  This prerelease contains several features, changes, improvements and bug fixes
  for the message compiler, improvements in C++ debugging support, an update of
  the Simulation Manual, and several fixes in preparation to the final 6.0
  release.
  
  Message compiler:
  
    - Changes in method names of the generated class. The `drop` method generated
      for owned pointer fields was renamed to `remove`; the single-argument
      `insert` method for arrays was changed to `append`.
  
    - Allow the `namespace;` syntax to make it possible to return to the toplevel
      C++ namespace.
  
    - Added the `@abstract` field and class property. For a field, it is
      equivalent to the `abstract` keyword; for classes it marks the whole
      class as abstract.
  
    - Abstract fields not to require the class to be marked with `@customize`.
  
    - Added the `@customImpl` field property. When specified, it suppresses
      generating implementations for the field's accessor methods, allowing custom
      implementations to be supplied by the user.
  
    - Introduced the `@datamemberType` property, and `@cppType` now serves as a default,
      for `@datamemberType`, `@argType`, and `@returnType`.
  
    - The generated class descriptors no longer use `operator<<` for converting
      field values to string in `getFieldValueAsString()`. Instead, `@toString` is
      used if the class has one, or the `str()` member if the type has one;
      otherwise the empty string is returned.
  
    - Many bug fixes and improvements.
  
  C++ Debugging Support:
  
    - Allow "Debug on Error" and "Debug Next Event" functionality to use the
      integrated debugger of the Simulation IDE. This required multiple changes.
      First, the IDE was extended to accept an URL which, when opened in the IDE,
      causes the integrated debugger to start a debug session and attach to a
      process given with its PID. This URL is:
  
      `omnetpp://cdt/debugger/attach?pid=<pid>`
  
      The URL can also opened from the command line, by running the `omnetpp`
      command with it as argument. The command opens the URL in the existing
      IDE instance if it is already running, or starts a new one if it does not.
  
      The second change was to update the default value of the
      `debugger-attach-command` configuration option to use the above command.
      (Previously it has used various other debuggers which were likely to be
      found on the host OS: GDB, Nemiver, VS Code, etc.)
  
  Analysis Tool:
  
    - Ask whether to keep temporary charts upon editor close, and only then.
  
    - Overhaul of the Bar Chart, Scatter Plot, and Box-and-Whiskers Plot chart
      templates.
  
    - Use an authentication token and explicit addresses for the Py4J
      connections between the IDE and Python processes, to improve security.
  
    - Added a version number to the `omnetpp.scave.*` Python modules.
  
    - Restore error marker functionality in the chart script editor, better error
      reporting from vector operations, and several further improvements and bug fixes.
  
  Documentation Generator:
  
    - Changed the XML format in which extra content for the generated NED
      documentation can be provided.
  
  Documentation:
  
    - Simulation Manual has been mostly updated for the current state. There are
      some remaining sections that need more work.
  
  Tools:
  
    - Added a new command named `opp_ide` to start the IDE, and made `omnetpp` and
      `omnest` to be its aliases.
  
    - `opp_charttool`: Added the `templates` command which lists the available chart
      templates.
  
    - `opp_run`: Added new `-h` topics: `latexconfigvars`, `sqliteschema`. They
      are mainly used for producing info for the Appendices in the manual.
  
    
  OMNeT++ 6.0pre15 (Dec 2021)
  ---------------------------

  This prerelease contains minor fixes and cleanups in preparation to the final
  6.0 release.

  Core:

    - Allow expressions in config option values to use NED operators, module
      parameters and other NED expression features. The immediate motivation
      was to be able use e.g. index in the `display-name` option, e.g.:
      `**.app[0..3].display-name = "cbr-" + string(index)`

    - The `displayName` field was moved from `cModule` to `cComponent`.

    - Result filters: The `count` and `sum` filter now record the initial zero
      value. This necessitated adding two methods to the `cResultListener` interface:
      added `emitInitialValue()` and `callEmitInitialValue()`.

    - Result files now include two new result attributes for each item: recording
      mode (the item in the `@statistic(record=...)` list that produced the given
      result item), and module/channel display names (`recordingmode`,
      `moduledisplaypath`).

    - In result files, the ", vector" suffix is now suppressed from the titles of
      vector results (similarly also "histogram" and "stats"), as they simply echo
      the result item's type. (They were there in the first place because
      recording mode is automatically appended to result titles `@statistic(title=...)`
      after a comma; it is now suppressed for the mentioned recording modes.)

    - SumPerDurationFilter: fix `getSumPerDuration()` behavior when invoked
      during warmup period.

  Analysis Tool:

    - Added the possibility to organize charts into a hierarchical folder
      structure. This can be very useful if the number of charts in the analysis
      exceeds a certain number. Charts can be moved between folders using
      copy/paste. Note that `.anf` files that contain folders are not understood by
      previous versions.

    - The "Reset Chart to Template" operation now allows multiple charts to be
      selected.

    - New chart template: "Line Chart on Separate Axes with Matplotlib".

    - New vector operation: `timedilation` (multiplies time with a constant).

    - Added a "Legend" page to the configuration dialogs of most chart templates.
      This page allows legend labels to be customized in several ways. Legend
      labels can now be specified manually, using a format string that may refer
      to dataframe columns as `$name`, `$title`, `$module`, etc. (content assist
      is available). For automatic legend labels, there is the option to use
      result titles (descriptive names) instead of result names, and module
      display name paths instead of plain module paths, where available. Finally,
      there is a possibility to perform a series of regular expression
      find/replace operations in the automatic or manual legend labels for fine
      tuning.

      Note that since charts in `.anf` files contain copies of their chart templates
      and not references to them, charts in existing `.anf` files need to be reset
      to their templates in order to gain the new Legend page (see context menu
      in the Charts page).

    - Automatic legend labels, axis and plot titles are now generated with a
      better algorithm.

    - Inside chart templates, there was an effort to structure charts scripts so
      that they have the structure of distinct result query, data preparation and
      plotting steps, where all three steps are ideally just one or two lines of
      code. To this end, several functions were factored out from chart scripts
      into `utils.py`: `plot_lines()`, `plot_boxwhiskers()`, `pivot_for_barchart()`,
      `pivot_for_scatterchart()`, `get_confidence_level()`, etc. `plot_bars()`
      was extended to accept a metadata df (for legend label generation), and
      it now expect the data df in transposed form.

    - There were several improvements in the `extract_label_columns()`,
      `make_legend_label()` and `make_chart_title()` functions (`utils.py`), to
      support improved legend label, axis label and plot title generation.

    - A distinct exception class `ChartScriptError` was introduced for errors that
      are to be displayed in the plot area without dumping the stack trace to the
      console.

    - Numerous bug fixes and smaller improvements. A notable bug fix is that of a
      crash due to errors in managing shared memory buffers used for communication
      between the IDE and Python processes of chart scripts. Numerous errors were
      fixed in chart image export (i.e. the Matplotlib emulation of native plotting
      widgets) as well.

  Inifile Editor:

    - Config option values that contain expressions are no longer falsely
      flagged as errors.

    - The confusing "Unused entry (does not match any parameters)" warning that
      often appeared falsely for INET simulations due to deficiencies in
      analyzing the network structure has been re-worded to include the
      possibility that it is false, and has also been demoted from "warning"
      to "info".

  IDE:

    - Update to Eclipse 4.22, CDT 10.5 and PyDev 9.2. The private JRE bundled with
      the IDE has been updated to Java 17 LTS.

  Sample simulations:

    - Fifo: Added a TandemQueues network, and related configurations into omnetpp.ini.

    - Resultfiles: Added the scalar and vector result files from the Fifo1 and
      Fifo2 simulations and the new TandemQueueExperiment.

  Tools:

    - `opp_charttool`: Filtering options (-i, -n) were improved to allow multiple
      charts to be selected. The -i option now accept index lists and ranges too,
      not only single indices. The -n option was changed to use substring match
      instead of full match.

    - `opp_charttool`: Added the "templates" command which lists the available
      chart templates.

    - `opp_test`: The set of possible test outcomes has been refined. Possible
      outcomes are now PASS, FAIL, ERROR, SKIP and EXPECTEDFAIL. SKIP means
      that the test was not performed, because e.g. it would test an optional
      feature which is currently disabled; ERROR means that the test was
      not performed, because of an unrecoverable error (i.e. crash or exception).
      It is possible to designate a test case as an "expected failure", by specifying
      `%expected-failure: Description of reason` in the test file. This is useful
      if we know that a certain test-case is correct, but it is not possible to fix
      it for certain reasons.

    - `opp_run -v` now outputs the system architecture OMNeT++ was built for
      (e.g. ARCH_X86_64 or ARCH_AARCH64).

    - On Windows and macOS, the directory names in the `tools` directory have changed
      to `win32.x86_64` and `macos.x86_64` respectively.

  Build:

    - The content of the `$PLATFORM` makefile variable has changed. Until know,
      it contained the `platform.architecture` pair (e.g. `win32.x86_64`) which was
      misleading. From now on, `Makefile.inc` provides `$PLATFORM` (e.g. `win32`)
      and `$ARCH` (e.g. `x86_64`) in separate variables. `makefrag` files must be
      updated if `$PLATFORM` variable was used in them.

    - To build OMNeT++ with Akaroa support, `WITH_AKAROA=yes` must be specified
      in the `configure.user` file. The configuration script no longer tries to
      autodetect Akaroa without the user explicitly requesting it.

      
  OMNeT++ 6.0pre14 (Nov 2021)
  ---------------------------
  
  This prerelease, just about a month after the previous one, comes with two
  important improvements in NED, follow-up changes in the simulation library,
  and several improvements in Qtenv and the Analysis Tool in the IDE.
  
  NED:
  
    - In a complex model framework, there is usually a large number of (module or
      channel) parameters, and so far it has not been obvious for users which
      parameters can be meaningfully changed at runtime. For example, if a simple
      module did not implement handleParameterChange() or the method did not cover
      a particular nonvolatile parameter, then the user could technically change
      that NED parameter at runtime, but the change did not take effect. This has
      often caused confusion.
  
      To remedy the situation, we introduced the @mutable property for parameters.
      If a particular parameter supports changing its value at runtime (i.e. the
      new value takes effect), then it should be marked with @mutable. If @mutable
      is missing, then trying to change the parameter will result in a runtime
      error ("Cannot change non-mutable parameter".)
  
      Parameters of ned.DelayChannel and ned.DatarateChannel are now marked
      @mutable.
  
      To allow running existing simulation models that have not yet been updated
      with @mutable annotations, we have added the parameter-mutability-check
      configuration option. Setting parameter-mutability-check=false will give
      back the old behavior.
  
    - Added the expr() operator to NED, with the purpose of allowing models to
      accept formulas or expressions which it could use e.g. to determine the
      processing time of a packet based on packet length or other properties,
      decide whether a packet should be allowed to pass or should be filtered out
      based on its contents (filter condition), or to derive x and y coordinates
      of a mobile node in the function of time.
  
      The argument to expr() is a NED expression which will typically contain free
      variables, (like x and y in expr(x+y)). The expr() operator creates an
      object that encapsulates the expression, so it can be assigned to parameters
      of the type "object". On the C++ side, the module implementation should
      query the parameter to get at the expression object (of type
      cOwnedDynamicExpression), and then it may bind the free variables and
      evaluate the expression as often as it wishes.
  
    - Object parameters now allow simple values (int, double, bool, string) as
      well. C++-wise, they are stored in the parameter in cValueHolder-wrapped
      cValue objects.
  
  MSG:
  
    - The @readonly property was added.
  
  Core:
  
    - cPar: Implemented isMutable() and the mechanism behind the new @mutable
      property.
  
    - Added the cOwnedDynamicExpression class which holds the result of NED expr()
      operators. cOwnedDynamicExpression is both cOwnedObject and
      cDynamicExpression (multiple inheritance). To make this possible, the
      cObject base class was removed from cExpression.
  
    - Added cValueHolder class. It instantiated as wrapper object around cValue
      when a non-object value (double, string, etc) is assigned to a NED parameter
      of the type "object".
  
    - Introduced cValueContainer as common base class for cValueHolder,
      cValueArray and cValueMap.
  
    - cValueMap/cValueArray: revert dup() to behave the same way cArray/cQueue
      does, i.e. only those objects that are owned by the cloned container are
      duplicated. This normally doesn't make much difference, but some NED
      expressions that relied on the old behavior now need to be adjusted. For
      example:
  
          object foo = {};
          object bar = dup([foo,foo]);  // --> error (contents of foo is not
                                        // cloned by cloning the array)
          object baz = [dup(foo), dup(foo)]  // OK
  
    - getModuleByPath() / findModuleByPath() moved to cComponent, so that
      they can be called on cChannels too.
  
    - Internal classes, global variables, etc moved into the omnetpp::internal
      namespace.
  
  Qtenv:
  
    - Log / Messages view: Slight change in the notation used for the source and
      destination modules of the message, in order to make it unambiguous. Use
      explicit "." and "^" to indicate the location of the module. Also, it now
      uses arrows of uniform lengths everywhere.
  
    - Added the "Fira Code" font as embedded resource, and set it to be used by
      default for the log window. The reason is that it provides nice --> arrow
      ligatures in the Messages view.
  
    - Fixed a bug where all further EV_* logging output was discarded after any
      module printed something into the log in its constructor.
  
  Analysis Tool:
  
    - On the Browse Data page, mask values that don't fit into their columns using
      '####'. This is akin to what MS Excel does.
  
    - Improved the appearance of Matplotlib-emulated native charts (which are used
      if a native chart is exported from the IDE or opp_charttool): added digit
      grouping to tick labels, made its appearance more consistent with the actual
      native plot regarding axis limits, number format for ticks, etc.
  
    - In the Python API, restored the omnetpp.scave.plot module (which was renamed
      ideplot in the last prerelease), in order not to break existing ANF files.
      Importing it will delegate to ideplot after issuing a "this is deprecated"
      warning.
  
    - Numerous bugs were fixed, including a complete IDE crash in rare cases.
  
  
  OMNeT++ 6.0pre13 (Oct 2021)
  ---------------------------
  
  Core:
  
    - Introduced cEnvir::pausePoint()
  
    - cValue changed to hold any_ptr instead of cObject. This change involves
      several changes, e.g. type OBJECT renamed to POINTER, and pointerValue() added.
  
    - cClassDescriptor: Added getFieldValue()/setFieldValue() methods
      to allow accessing fields in a typed way, using cValue. Previously
      existing methods getFieldValueAsString()/setFieldValueAsString()
      only allowed string-based access.
  
    - Message compiler: Follow cClassDescriptor change: generate getFieldValue()
      and setFieldValue() methods. Added new properties @toValue()/@fromValue()
      so that user can define how to implement those.
  
    - cPar: added cValue-based generic access: getValue(), setValue()
  
    - cProperty: added getNumKeys() method; updateWith() made public
  
    - cResultFilter, cResultRecorder: grouped init() args into a Context struct,
      The old init() methods have been preserved as deprecated (and invoked from
      the new init()) in case an existing filter/recorder overrides them. Note
      that potential external calls to the old init() method won't work any more
      (they will have no effect), and need to be changed to the new version.
  
    - Added MergeFilter, a result filter that allows multiple inputs,
      and multiplexes them onto its singe output. It is available (as the
      merge() function) in the source= part of @statistic.
  
    - Fixed histogram loading issue in the output scalar file (.sca). Bin edges
      that are very close could become equal in the file if insufficient printing
      precision was set, rendering the file unreadable. The issue is now handled
      both during result file writing (if such condition is detected, bin edges
      are written with full [16-digit] precision) and reading (zero-width bins are
      merged into adjacent nonzero-width bin).
  
    - Further bug fixes and minor improvements.
  
  Qtenv:
  
    - Object Inspector: Added possibility to select display mode (Children/
      Grouped/Flat/Inheritance) per-node. If display mode override is specified
      for a node, it will affect the whole subtree. The display mode for the
      selected tree can be changed via hotkey (Ctrl+B) or via the context menu.
  
    - Log: Show component init stages as banners, but hide empty ones.
  
    - Prevent manually enabled "Debug on Errors" setting to be turned
      off by (lack of) configuration option.
  
    - Various bug fixes.
  
  IDE:
  
    - Analysis Tool: Multiple UI improvements:
  
        - When plotting results from the Browse Data page, prefer native plotting
          to Matplotlib. Native plots are both more scalable and also arguably
          more convenient to use.
  
        - In the Scatter Plot config dialog, the "Iso line" terminology changed to
          "Group by" (suggested by Edward Longman).
  
        - When setting the name of a chart, also set its title, if it was empty before.
  
        - Improve focus handling on tab switching in the Chart Properties dialog.
  
        - Fix the bug where middle-click closing a chart tab would discard changes silently.
  
        - Added "timewinthruput" vector operation
  
        - Python API: The "plot" module (omnetpp.scave.plot) was renamed to "ideplot".
          Charts in existing ANF files need to be either recreated, or the import
          line and usages of the plot module in the chart script need to be changed
          accordingly.
  
    - Added support for ARM-based Linux distros
  
    - JustJ: Use stripped version of JDK 15 instead of JDK 11
  
  Build:
  
    - `setenv` is used now on Windows to set up the build environment.
      It is automatically sourced when mingwenv.cmd or vcenv.cmd is started.
  
    - If `setenv_local` file is present in the installation root, it is
      automatically sourced from the `setenv` script. This can be used to
      set up user specific environment variables.
  
  Documentation:
  
    - Install Guide updated. New sections in the macOS chapter: "Enabling
      Development Mode in the Terminal", "Running OMNeT++ on Apple Silicon"
  
  
  OMNeT++ 6.0pre12 (Jul 2021)
  ---------------------------
  
  Simulation kernel:
  
    - NED functions that take or return values of type 'object' are now allowed.
  
    - cModule now keeps track of submodule vectors as entities, and not just as
      a collection of submodules with vector indices, meaning that we can now
      distinguish between nonexistent and zero-size submodule vectors. Random
      access of vector elements has also became more efficient (constant-time
      operation). Several new methods have been added as part of this change:
      hasSubmoduleVector(), getSubmoduleVectorSize(), addSubmoduleVector(),
      deleteSubmoduleVector(), setSubmoduleVectorSize(), getSubmoduleVectorNames().
  
    - As part of the above change, several cModule and cModuleType methods have been
      added or updated. A partial list:
  
      - In cModule, the hasSubmodule(), getSubmoduleNames(), hasGateVector(),
        hasGates() methods have been added for consistency between submodule and
        gate APIs.
      - The return type of the getGateNames() method has been changed from
        std::string<const char*> to std::vector<std::string>, for consistency
        with getSubmoduleNames().
      - cModule: added setIndex() and setNameAndIndex().
      - cModule, cGate: getIndex(), getVectorSize(), gateSize() and similar methods
        now throw for non-vector submodules/gates.
      - cModule: add separate addGateVector() method instead misusing addGate()
        for creating gate vectors, also for consistency with addSubmoduleVector().
      - In cModuleType::create(), the vectorSize parameter of create() has been removed
      - In cModuleType::createScheduleInit(), an index argument was added to allow
        creating submodule vector elements.
      - cModule: added addSubmodule() method which flows more naturally than
        cModuleType::create().
  
    - There have been changes in submodule and channel iterators. SubmoduleIterator
      has been rewritten due to the change in how submodule vectors are represented,
      which may affect the iteration order in some cases. Iterators now throw an
      exception if a change occurs in the list of submodules/channels during
      iteration. Their APIs have also changed a little: operator-- was removed,
      and init(m) renamed to reset().
  
    - Improvements in the multi-stage initialization protocol with regard to
      dynamic module creation. Modules now keep track of the last init stage
      they completed (lastCompletedInitStage). During an init stage, iteration
      of modules is restarted if creation/deletion is detected during iteration;
      modules already initialized in the previous round are recognized and skipped
      with the help of lastCompletedInitStage.
  
    - cComponent: added getNedTypeAndFullName() and getNedTypeAndFullPath().
      They are especially useful in constructing error messages in NED functions.
  
    - Minor changes in the model change notification classes. In
      cPreModuleAddNotification, the vectorSize field was removed (as it was
      redundant), and in cPostModuleDeleteNotification, the interpretation of
      the index field has changed a little: if the deleted module was not part
      of a module vector, index is now set to -1 instead of 0.
  
    - New classes: opp_pooledstring, opp_staticpooledstring. They provide pool-
      backed string storage (reference counted and non reference counted,
      respectively). In turn, the cStringPool class was removed; use either
      of the pooled string classes or or opp_staticpooledstring::get(const char *)
      instead.
  
    - cValueArray: added asIntVectorInUnit(), asDoubleVectorInUnit() functions
  
    - Store origin (file:line) in cPar parameters (more precisely, in
      cDynamicExpression), so we can report it on evaluation errors.
      Most visible change: cPar::parse() gained an extra FileLine argument.
      Also, cDynamicExpression now has get/setSourceLocation()
  
    - cNedFunction: added search by name AND accepted number of args.
  
    - cXMLElement change: resolve $MODULE_INDEX, $PARENTMODULE_NAME and similar
      variables to empty string if they are not applicable.
  
    - Several string functions have been made available for models. A
      representative partial list: opp_isempty(), opp_isblank(),
      opp_nulltoempty(), opp_trim(), opp_split(), opp_splitandtrim(),
      opp_join(), opp_stringendswith(), opp_substringbefore(), etc.
  
    - cStringTokenizer has been rewritten. It now supports features like
      optional skipping of empty tokens, optional trimming of tokens, optional
      honoring of quotes, optional honoring of parens/brackets/brackets
      (i.e. the input string is not broken into tokens in the middle of a
      parenthesized expression).
  
    - cClassDescriptor: methods changed to use any_ptr instead of void*
      for passing the object. (any_ptr is a smart pointer class that provides
      type safety for void* pointers.) Pointers need to be put into and extracted
      from any_ptr using the new toAnyPtr() / fromAnyPtr() functions. They have
      specialized versions for each type (via templates and overloading).
      For new types, the message compiler generates toAnyPtr()/fromAnyPtr()
      in the header file. For the simulation library classes, these methods
      come from "sim_std_m.h" (generated from sim_std.msg); "sim_std_m.h"
      is now part of <omnetpp.h>.
  
    - Various other improvements in the simulation library.
  
  NED:
  
    - Semantics change: Within a submodule's or connection's curly brace block,
      the interpretation of parameter/gate/submodule references that don't use an
      explicit "parent" or "this" qualifier has changed. They no longer refer to
      the enclosing compound module's item, but to the item of (or within) the
      local submodule or channel object. The interpretation of item references
      outside subcomponent blocks has remained unchanged. An example:
  
          network Network {
            parameters:
                int foo;
            submodules:
              node1: { ... }
              node2: Node {
                foo = foo; // ERROR: self-reference! Change to 'foo=parent.foo'.
                bar = this.foo;  // OK
                baz = node1.foo;  // ERROR: refers to yet-uncreated submodule node2.node1!
                bax = parent.node1.foo;  // OK
              }
          }
  
      The set of forms accepted by exists() and sizeof() has been expanded.
      Notably, exists() can now be used to check the existence of an item in a
      submodule vector (as submodule vectors may now contain holes, due to
      @omittedTypename). However, the index() syntax has been removed, index is
      only accepted without parens.
  
      Note that referencing a submodule's submodule from NED (i.e. the a.b or
      this.a.b syntax within a submodule block) is generally wrong, because
      submodules are only created after parameters have already been set up. (An
      exception is volatile parameters, as they are only evaluated when the
      parameter value is actually read.)
  
      Error messages have been revised and expanded to be more helpful and
      facilitate porting NED code from 5.x.
  
      To write NED which is compatible with both OMNeT++ version 5.x and 6.0,
      qualify all references within subcomponent blocks with explicit "parent"
      or "this", and require OMNeT++ 5.7 which is the first and only 5.x version
      that understands the "parent" keyword.
  
    - Added support for Universal Function Call Syntax (UFCS) to NED, which means
      that now any function call may also be written as if the function was a
      method of its first argument (provided it has one). That is, f(x,..) can now
      be also written in the alternative form x.f(...). This results in improved
      readability in certain cases, and allows chaining function calls.
  
    - New NED functions: get(), size(), eval(), dup(). eval() evaluates a NED
      expression given as string. dup() simply calls an object's C++ dup() method;
      it is useful because module parameters of type 'object' only accept objects
      they fully own, which can be worked around using dup(). An example:
  
        object a = [1,2,3];
        object b = dup(a);  // without dup() it is an error: value is owned by parameter 'a'
  
    - NED functions for reading (from file) and parsing (from string) of CSV,
      JSON and XML files: parseCSV(), readCSV(), parseExtendedCSV(),
      readExtendedCSV(), parseJSON(), readJSON(), parseExtendedJSON(),
      readExtendedJSON(), parseXML(), readXML(). The "extended" variants support
      expressions in the file, which will be evaluated during parsing. The XML
      functions are aliases to the existing xml()/xmldoc() functions. Bonus
      file-related functions: readFile(), workingDir(), baseDir(), resolveFile(),
      absFilePath().
  
    - Allow the body of a parametric submodule to assign apparently nonexistent
      parameters. Example:
  
              app: <default("FooApp")> like IApp {
                  parameters:
                      address = parent.address;
                      sleepTime = 1s;
              }
  
      If FooApp has a sleepTime parameter but IApp does not, then running with
      the defaults is fine, but changing to another IApp type that does NOT
      have a sleepTime parameter will stop the simulation with an error.
  
      Solution: inside a parametric submodule type, we simply ignore parameter
      assignments that assign seemingly nonexistent parameters.
  
    - Implemented @omittedTypename property. @omittedTypename allows one to
      specify a NED type to use when typename="" is specified for a parametric
      submodule or channel, or to remove (skip creating) that submodule, submodule
      vector element, or channel altogether.
  
      @omittedTypename can be specified on a module interface or channel
      interface, or on a submodule or connection. It should contain a single
      (optional) value. The value names the type to use. If it is absent, the
      submodule or channel will not be created. (The connection will be created
      without a channel object.)
  
    - Improved error reporting during network building: when an error occurs
      during assigning a parameter from a NED file, the error message now includes
      the location of the assignment (file:line in NED file).
  
  Ini files:
  
    - It is now possible to break long lines without using a trailing backslash.
      Continuation lines are marked as such by indenting them, i.e. an indented
      line is now interpreted as a continuation of the previous line. (It is not
      possible to break a line inside a string constant that way.) Breaking lines
      using a trailing backslash way still works (and it can also be used
      to break string constants, too).
  
    - The "Config " prefix in section headers is now optional. That is,
      [Config PureAloha] may now be also written as [PureAloha], the two
      are equivalent.
  
  IDE:
  
    - Several improvements in various editors.
  
    - Update to Eclipse 4.20, CDT 10.3 and PyDev 8.3. Another change is that
      the JRE in the IDE is now provided by Eclipse JustJ project.
  
  
  OMNeT++ 6.0pre11 (Apr 2021)
  ---------------------------
  
  This prerelease contains many small changes and improvements. The highlight
  of this release is the Sequence Chart tool in the IDE which has been revised
  and significantly extended with new functionality. NOTE: the eventlog (.elog)
  file format has changed in a non-backward-compatible way.
  
  The summary of changes since 6.0pre10:
  
  Core:
  
    - Added display name support to modules. Display name is a string that
      optionally appears in Qtenv next to (or instead of) the normal module
      name, in order to help the user distinguish between similarly-named
      submodules. For example, application-layer modules app[0], app[1], etc.
      in INET may be given descriptive names like "file transfer", "video",
      "voice", or "CBR", and have them displayed in Qtenv. Display names may be
      set using the **.display-name per-module configuration option, or
      programmatically by calling setDisplayName().
  
    - Added the "g=<group>" (layout group) display string tag, which makes it
      possible to apply predefined arrangements like row, column, matrix or ring
      to a group of unrelated submodules. This layouting feature was previously
      only available for submodule vectors. When "g" tags are used, submodules
      in the same group are now regarded for layouting purposes as if they
      were part of the same submodule vector.
  
    - Made it possible to specify display strings in the configuration. The
      value given in the **.display-string per-component configuration option
      is merged into the component's display string in the same way inheritance
      or submodule display strings work: it may add, overwrite or remove items
      from it.
  
    - Change in the parameter change notification mechanism: Calls to the
      handleParameterChange() method during initialization are no longer
      suppressed. Because now every change results in a notification, the
      umbrella handleParameter(nullptr) call at the end of the initialization
      is no longer needed and has been removed. The consequence is that
      handleParameterChange() methods need to be implemented more carefully,
      because they may be called at a time when the module may not have
      completed all initialization stages. Also, if an existing model relied on
      handleParameter(nullptr) being called, it needs to be updated.
  
    - Module name and full name (i.e. name[index]) are now stringpooled, which
      reduces memory usage in exchange for a small build-time extra cost.
      In addition, string pools now use std::unordered_map instead of std::map,
      which results in improved performance.
  
    - Signature change of the cVisitor::visit(cObject *obj) virtual method: it
      can now request end of iteration via returning false (hence, return type
      changed from void to bool) instead of throwing EndTraversalException.
      Existing cVisitor subclasses in model code will need to be adjusted.
  
    - cValue's doubleValue() and intValue() methods now throw an exception when
      called on a value that has a measurement unit, in order to reduce usage
      mistakes. If the value has a unit, call either doubleValueInUnit() /
      intValueInUnit(), or doubleValueRaw()/intValueRaw() plus getUnit().
  
    - The setPerformFinalGC() method was removed. It was meant for internal
      use, and pretty much unused by model code.
  
    - cHasher: add(const std::string&) changed to be consistent with the
      add(const char *) overload. This may cause fingerprint changes in models
      that use it.
  
    - Eventlog recording: Implemented snapshot and incremental index support.
      This introduces means significant (breaking) changes in the elog file
      format. Several new configuration options to control eventlog recording:
      eventlog-max-size, eventlog-min-truncated-size, eventlog-snapshot-frequency,
      eventlog-index-frequency, eventlog-options. See also changes in the
      Sequence Chart Tool below.
  
    - Many other bug fixes and improvements; see the ChangeLog files under src/
      for details.
  
  Qtenv:
  
    - Added support for showing a submodule's display name under the icon
      instead of, or in addition to, the normal name. The format can be
      selected in the context menu.
  
    - Added support for new columns in the packet log view: TxUpdate, Durations,
      Length, Info. This was implemented in the cDefaultMessagePrinter class
      which is part of the simulation library. This change makes it possible
      to see if a packet is a transmission update (except if the simulation
      installs its own packet printer like INET does).
  
  Eventlog:
  
    - The eventlog file format has been changed substantially. You won't be able
      to open older eventlog files with this version of the IDE, nor new files in
      previous IDE versions.
  
    - The most prominent change is the introduction of snapshot and index chunks in
      addition to the already recorded event chunks. The former contains a complete
      snapshot of the relevant simulation state without referring to any other line
      in the file. The latter provides the set of changes in the relevant simulation
      state since the last index or snapshot chunk. The contents of the index chunk
      is expressed as references to other lines of the eventlog file. This change in
      the eventlog format provides the foundation for a better user experience in
      the IDE especially for large eventlog files.
  
    - Several new eventlog recording related configuration options have been added
      to the INI file format.
  
      - the 'eventlog-snapshot-frequency' configuration option specifies how often
        snapshots are recorded in the evenlog file. Snapshots help various tools to
        handle large eventlog files more efficiently. Specifying greater value means
        less help, while smaller value means bigger eventlog files.
  
      - the 'eventlog-index-frequency' configuration option specifies how often
        indices are recorder in the eventlog file. An index is much smaller than a
        full snapshot, but it only contains the differences since the last index.
        Specifying greater value means less help, while smaller value means bigger
        eventlog files.
  
      - the 'eventlog-max-size' configuration option specifies the maximum size of
        the eventlog file in bytes. The eventlog file is automatically truncated
        when this limit is reached.
  
      - the 'eventlog-min-truncated-size' configuration options specifies the minimum
        size of the eventlog file in bytes after the file is truncated. Truncation
        means older events are discarded while newer ones are kept.
  
      - the 'eventlog-options' configuration option allows to record only certain
        categories reducing the eventlog file size (e.g. text, message, module,
        methodcall, displaystring).
  
  Sequence Chart:
  
    - The visualization of events have been horizontally expanded on the chart, now
      it uses long rounded rectangles instead of small circles. This change allows
      the separate visualization of method calls without overlapping. If method
      calls are hidden then the chart falls back to the old behavior where events
      are small circles.
  
    - The set of displayed axes can be explicitly configured independently from the
      set of displayed events. The chart now also supports displaying events on a
      compound module axis if the corresponding submodule axis is hidden. Collapsing
      and expanding module axes can be done using the mouse.
  
    - The chart now also displays a set of axis headers on the left side that shows
      the module hierarchy in a compact and interactive way.
  
    - All parts of the sequence chart can be separately shown/hidden.
  
    - The selection has been extended with support for axis and method calls.
  
    - A new time measurement feature has been added that allows measuring the time
      difference between multiple events and other interesting points in time.
  
    - Several automatic configuration presets have been added (e.g. network level,
      full detail, default) to make the configuration for the most common chart use
      cases easier.
  
    - A new pattern matching based user defined colorization (e.g. message sends,
      method calls, axes, events) feature has been added. This feature allows
      creating more easily understandable sequence charts by encoding certain model
      properties as colors.
  
    - The chart can display eventlog file statistics and operation statistics.
  
  Analysis Tool:
  
    - Allow editing the pages of the "Configure Chart" dialog. The "Edit pages"
      button in the dialog brings up the new "Edit Chart Dialog Pages" dialog.
  
    - Chart template gallery improvements: improved dialog and content.
  
    - "Reset Chart To Template": added dialog for choosing which elements to reset.
  
    - Properties view to show chart properties when chart is selected.
  
    - Vector Operations: on selecting the operation from the context menu,
      ask the filter's parameters before adding it.
  
    - In the "Configure Chart" dialog, added content assist to the "Vector
      Operations" field.
  
    - Make native plot legend background and border semi-transparent.
  
    - Automatically refresh open chart when set of loaded result files change.
  
    - Chart page toolbar: added "Refresh Result Files" icon; zoom icons redesigned;
      other improvements.
  
    - Improved scatterchart and boxplots chart templates.
  
    - Fix: Don't move the cursor upon error when the source editor is focused.
  
    - Many more bugfixes and improvements; see the ChangeLog files under ui/
      for details.
  
  Inifile Editor:
  
    - Added support for ignorable options. User can mark custom config options
      as ones to be ignored by the editor.
  
    - Get rid of asynchronous/delayed form page reread in FormPage.
  
  IDE General:
  
    - Install Simulation Models dialog: Added support for changing the project
      name and location on download. The (default) project name is now coming
      from the descriptor file even if INET is installed on the Welcome screen.
  
    - Turned on showing line numbers ruler in source editors by default.
  
    - Added an XML editor, language server, terminal, and marketplace client
      to the IDE.
  
  Tools:
  
    - opp_charttool: The functionality of opp_charttool has been made available
      for Python programs as a library module called "omnetpp.scave.analysis".
  
  
  OMNeT++ 6.0pre10 (December 2020)
  --------------------------------
  
  This prerelease contains many small changes and improvements. Additionally,
  due to improvements in the toolchain and the build process, Windows users
  may see the linking time of large models like INET Framework to drop
  dramatically (1-2 orders magnitude, e.g. from several minutes to several
  seconds).
  
  The summary of changes since 6.0pre9:
  
  Core:
  
    - Refactoring: Some classes, methods and variables related to ownership
      management were renamed: cDefaultOwner -> cSoftOwner; defaultOwner ->
      owningContext, etc.
  
    - Slight change to the operation of preDelete() introduced in the previous
      prerelease: it is now called via callPreDelete() which does the recursion part,
      so preDelete() itself doesn't recurse any more. Also, we switch the context
      to the module for the duration of the preDelete() call.
  
    - Two utility functions were added to cObject: getClassAndFullPath() and
      getClassAndFullName(). They are mostly useful in logging and error messages.
  
    - Canvas API: Added text alignment support to text and label figures:
      cFigure::Alignment enum, getAlignment()/setAlignment() in cAbstractTextFigure.
  
    - Canvas API: cFigure::RGBA: added toAlpha() method, and a constructor taking
      Color.
  
    - Fingerprints: Due a bugfix in cHasher::add(const char *), fingerprints that
      involve hashing strings changed their values.
  
    - Fingerprints: Changed the way fingerprints are computed from figures. Most
      importantly, fingerprints are now affected by all visual properties, not just
      geometry information. This change only affects fingerprints that contain the
      'f' (=figures) ingredient.
  
    - Changed the configuration options that control the operation of the "Fake GUI"
      Cmdenv feature, which is useful for computing fingerprints from simulations
      with custom animation. See config options starting with "cmdenv-fakegui-".
  
    - Removed the support for OMNeT++ 4.x fingerprints (USE_OMNETPP4x_FINGERPRINTS).
  
    - Changed the NED package exclusion mechanism that was introduced in an earlier
      6.0 prerelease. Exclusions are now specified in terms of package names
      instead of folders. To this end, the "-x" command-line option changed meaning
      (takes package list instead of folder list), and also, the ned-exclusion-path
      config option was renamed to ned-package-exclusions, and the OMNETPP_NED_-
      EXCLUSION_PATH environment variable to OMNETPP_NED_PACKAGE_EXCLUSIONS.
  
    - Source code modernization: use in-class member initializers wherever possible.
  
  Qtenv:
  
    - Turn off animating method calls by default. The rationale is that method
      call animations usually expose low-level (C++ implementation level)
      details on the GUI, which are rarely of interest to a casual user.
  
    - Added the possibility to disable method calls locally (per module type)
      via the context menu, even when the global switch in the Preferences dialog
      is turned on.
  
    - Changed the factory default of "Allow backward arrows for hops" to false.
  
    - Fix osgEarth viewpoints ignoring SRS (PR #851).
  
  IDE:
  
    - Numerous bug fixes
  
    - Launcher: Pass NED exclusions to the simulation program as -x options.
      NED exclusions typically come from disabled project features, e.g. in INET.
  
  Build:
  
    - Allow using the LLD linker by default (if present on the system). LLD is
      potentially much faster than the standard GNU linker. For example, the
      use of LLD, together with other changes that were part done in INET,
      reduced INET linking time on Windows from 380s (!) to 2s (!!!) in DEBUG
      mode, and from 90s to 5s in RELEASE mode on one of our dev boxes.
  
    - When building DLL files (shared libraries) on Windows, the build process now
      generates <name>.def and <name>.dll.a files in addition to the resulting
      <name>.dll file. The <name>.ddl.a file is a static import library that can
      be used by other dependent projects to link with the model in the shared
      library. The <name>.def file can be used to check what methods were actually
      exported from the model.
  
  Misc:
  
    - Install Guide updated.
  
  
  OMNeT++ 6.0pre9 (October 2020)
  ------------------------------
  
  A long time, six months have passed since the last prerelease, and, as a
  consequence, we have accumulated a lot of changes. Arguably the most important
  change is an update to the OMNeT++ programming model: the introduction of the
  possibility to update ongoing packet transmissions, that is, the ability to
  abort, shorten, or extend a packet (usually an L2 frame) while it is being
  transmitted. Significant amount of work has been put into improving the looks
  and functionality of Qtenv, and into refining the Python-based Analysis Tool in
  the IDE. There were numerous other improvements as well -- read on for details.
  
  Transmission updates in the simulation kernel:
  
    - A description of the new "transmission updates" functionality follows.
      We start with an overview, then go into API details and related changes.
  
    - The initial send() is interpreted as: "packet transmission begins now,
      packet content and duration are, as things are now, going to be this".
  
      Following that, an "update" (or any number of updates) can be sent.
      An update is a packet with the updated ("actual") content, and with a
      "remaining transmission duration" attached. Updates may only
      be sent while transmission is still ongoing.
  
      As an example, aborting a transmission is done by sending a
      packet with a truncated content and a remaining duration of zero.
  
      Transmission updates are paired with the original packet they modify
      using a transmissionId. The transmissionId is normally chosen to be the
      packet ID of the original transmission. Channels should understand
      updates and handle them accordingly.
  
      Receivers that receive the packet at the end of the reception, which is the
      default operating mode, will only receive the final update. The original
      packet and intermediate updates are absorbed by the simulation kernel.
  
      Receivers that receive the packet at the start of the reception (see
      cGate::setDeliverImmediately(), ex setDeliverOnReceptionStart())
      should be prepared to receive all of the original packet and the
      updates, and handle them appropriately. Tx updates can be recognized
      from cPacket::isUpdate() returning true. cPacket::getRemainingDuration()
      returns the remaining transmission duration, and cPacket::getDuration()
      the total transmission duration.
  
      As a safeguard against unprepared modules accidentally processing
      tx updates as normal full-blown packets, the module is only given
      tx updates if it explicitly declares that it is able to handle them
      properly. The latter is done by the module calling
      setTxUpdateSupport(true) e.g. in initialize().
  
      Non-transmission channels don't handle updates any different from
      other messages and packets.
  
      Details and related changes follow.
  
    - send() and sendDirect() now accept a SendOptions struct where optional
      parameters such as delay can be passed in. sendDelayed() and other
      send()/sendDirect() variants now convert their extra args to a SendOptions,
      and delegate to the "standard" send()/sendDirect() versions. SendOptions was
      introduced as a means to handle combinatorial explosion of send() variants.
  
    - cDatarateChannel now allows overriding the duration (which is normally
      computed from the packet length and the channel datarate) from the send()
      call.
  
    - cDatarateChannel: non-packet messages now pass through without
      interfering with packets.
  
    - cDatarateChannel: disabled channels now let transmission updates through,
      so that it is possible for the transmitter module to abort the
      ongoing packet transmission.
  
    - Note: tx updates (without duration/remainingDuration) are allowed
      on paths without transmission channels.
  
    - Signature change in methods that participate in the send()/sendDirect()
      protocol: SendOptions was added to the arg list. This affects:
      cGate::deliver(), cModule::arrived(), cChannel::processMessage()
  
    - In cChannel::processMessage(), result_t was renamed cChannel::Result,
      and it is now a proper return value (not an output parameter)
  
    - remainingDuration was added to cChannel::Result.
  
    - cDatarateChannel's datarate is now optional: set it to 0 or nan
      to leave it unspecified.  This change was necessary to support
      transmitting frames with per-frame data rate selection.
  
    - cDatarateChannel now optionally allows multiple concurrent transmissions,
      with or without any bookkeeping and associated checks. This is useful for
      modeling a channel with contention-based access and collisions, such as
      classic Ethernet. The operating mode has to be selected programmatically,
      with the channel's setMode() method. Possible modes are SINGLE, MULTI and
      UNCHECKED.
  
    - The forceTransmissionFinishTime() method of channels has been deprecated.
      It was always meant as a temporary device to allow implementing aborting
      frame transmissions, and now with the arrival of the new transmission
      update API there is no reason to use it any more. Simulations using it
      should be migrated to the new API.
  
    - Rename: setDeliverOnReceptionStart() -> setDeliverImmediately()
  
    - Added cSimpleModule::supportsTxUpdates() flag
  
    - cPacket now carries a remainingDuration field
  
    - cPacket: eliminated FL_ISRECEPTIONSTART; isReceptionStart() now uses
      remainingDuration as input; added a similar isReceptionEnd() method.
  
    - cPacket::str() overhaul to reflect new fields and uses
  
    - In the APIs, sendDelay and propagationDelay (which were sort of
      combined into a single value) are now distinct, and handled
      separately.
  
    - Eventlog format changes: BeginSendEntry: added sendDelay and
      transmissionId; SendHopEntry, SendDirectEntry: added remainingDuration
  
  Simulation kernel, other changes:
  
    - cSimpleModule: added scheduleAfter(), rescheduleAt(), rescheduleAfter()
      methods. This is mainly for convenience, but using rescheduleAt() instead of
      a cancelEvent() followed by a scheduleAt() will eventually allow for a more
      efficient implementation.
  
    - getModuleByPath() adjustment: It will now never return nullptr, even for
      the empty string given as path. Instead it will throw an exception if the
      module was not found. This change makes this method consistent with other
      getter methods in the simulation library, and allows nullptr checks to be
      removed from model code that uses it.
  
    - cComponent: added preDelete(). This a virtual method that the user can
      override to add tasks to be done before the module (or channel) is deleted.
      When deleteModule() is called on a compound module, it first invokes
      preDelete() recursively on the submodule tree, and only starts deleting
      modules after that. preDelete() can help simplify network or module deletion
      in a complex simulation that involves model change listeners.
  
    - Added opp_component_ptr<T>. It implements a smart pointer that points to
      a cComponent (i.e. a module or channel), and automatically becomes nullptr
      when the referenced object is deleted. It is a non-owning ("weak") pointer,
      i.e. the pointer going out of scope has no effect on the referenced object.
      opp_component_ptr<T> can be useful in implementing modules that hold
      pointers to other modules and want to be prepared for those modules
      getting deleted. It can also be useful for simplifying safe destruction
      of compound modules containing such modules.
  
    - A new method, findModuleByPath() was added for cases when an optionally
      existing module needs to be found.
  
    - cIListener's destructor now unsubscribes from all places it was subscribed
      to. This change was necessitated by the following deleteModule() change.
  
    - deleteModule(): Module destruction sequence was changed so that when
      deleting a compound module, the compound module's local listeners are
      notified about the deletion of the submodules.
  
    - deleteModule() internals refactored. The motivation was to avoid doing
      things like firing pre-model-change notifications from a halfway-deleted
      module. Now we do every potentially risky thing (such as deleting submodules
      and disconnecting gates) from doDeleteModule(), and only delete the module
      object when it is already barebones (no submodules, gates, listeners, etc).
      With this change, the deletion sequence is now pretty much the reverse of
      the setup sequence.
  
    - Now it is allowed for modules to be deleted (including self-deletion) and
      created at will during initialization.
  
    - cMessage: allow isMessage() to be called from subclasses.
  
    - Added the autoWarmupFilter statistic attribute that allows one to disable
      auto-adding the warmup filter to a statistic. Example:
  
        @statistic[foo](record=vector;autoWarmupFilter=false);
  
      This will cause all values from the foo signal to be recorded, even
      values emitted during the warm-up period (if one is set).
  
      However, the real motivation behind this feature is to allow the user to add
      the warm-up filter at a non-default location in the filter chain. By
      default, the warm-up filter is added at the start of the filter chain (right
      before the first filter), but this is not always what is needed.
  
      For example, "@statistic[foo](source=min;record=vector)" is equivalent to
      "@statistic[foo](source=min(warmup(foo));autoWarmupFilter=false;record=vector)",
      and records (as vector) the minimum of the values which were emitted after
      the warmup period is over. In contrast, if we replace "min(warmup(foo))"
      with "warmup(min(foo))", it will compute the minimum of ALL values, but only
      starts recording the result after the warmup period has expired.
  
      This is a crucial difference sometimes. For example, a statistic might
      record queue length computed as the difference of the number of messages
      that entered the queue and those that left it:
  
        @statistic[queueLen](source=count(pkIn)-count(pkOut);record=vector); //INCORRECT
  
      In this case, if a warmup period is set, the result may even go negative
      because the pkIn and pkOut signals that arrive during the warmup period
      are ignored, and if pkOut arrives after that, we are at -1. The correct
      solution is to add the warmup filter after the difference between arrivals
      and departures have been computed:
  
        @statistic[queueLen](source=warmup(count(pkIn)-count(pkOut));autoWarmupFilter=false;record=vector); //OK
  
      The autoWarmupFilter option exists because either location for the warmup
      filter (beginning or end of the chain, or even mid-chain) may make sense for
      certain statistics. The model author needs to decide per-statistic which one
      is correct.
  
    - Added DemuxFilter, which allows splitting the stream of values arriving
      from a signal to multiple streams. For example, if values from the foo
      signal are tagged with the labels "first", "second" and "third", then the
      following statistics:
  
        @statistic[foo](record=count(demux(foo)));
  
      will produce three scalars: "foo:count(demux):first",
      "foo:count(demux):second", and "foo:count(demux):third".
  
      Note: in the 6.0pre13, the demux label was moved to the front of the name:
      "first:foo:count(demux)", etc.
  
      The labels are taken from the (full) name of the details object
      specified in the emit() call.
  
      This filter is especially useful if you intend to save multiple instances
      of the same statistics from the same module (e.g. per-connection TCP
      statistics).
  
    - Added the "parsim-num-partitions" config option, which makes it possible
      to explicitly declare the number of partitions to be used with parallel
      simulation. (Before, it was explicitly taken by OMNeT++ from MPI or the
      respective communication layer.)
  
  Samples:
  
    - Added the "wiredphy" sample simulation to demonstrate transmission updates.
  
  General:
  
    - Updated Eclipse to version 4.17 and CDT to version 10.0.
  
    - Updated toolchains and binary dependencies on Windows and macOS.
  
    - On Windows, binary dependencies used by simulations, such as Qt, OSG,
      osgEarth, etc., are now separated from the rest of the toolchain binaries
      (compiler, etc.). You can find them in the "tools/win64/opt" directory. This
      is useful when creating a standalone binary distribution of a simulation.
  
    - On Windows, the build system now generates a proper import library
      when creating a shared library (with the name "targetname.dll.a").
      External projects must link against that library instead of linking directly
      with the "targetname.dll" file. (Note that the linker automatically uses the
      ".dll.a" files if they are present in the library path and falls back to use the
      pure ".dll" file only if the import library is not present. It means that you
      don't have to do anything extra to use these files apart from making them
      available along your ".dll" files.)
  
    - The Windows toolchain now contains the (much faster) LLD linker. However,
      it is disabled by default because of certain issues with generating incorrect
      import libraries. You can enable it by adding the "-fuse-ld=lld"
      option to the "LDFLAGS" variable in "Makefile.inc", or invoking make as
      "make LDFLAGS_EXTRA=-fuse-ld=lld". On Linux, the LLD linker is used by
      default if it is detected during the configuration process.
  
    - For Qtenv, raised the minimum required Qt version to 5.6.
  
    - Install Guide: Added instructions to install OMNeT++ on WSL (Windows
      Subsystem for Linux) on Windows 10. We found that running OMNeT++
      on WSL is considerably faster than using it with the native Windows
      toolchain!
  
    - Better debugging experience by fine tuning the compiler options
      (especially with the clang compiler).
  
    - You can force Qtenv to use Visual Studio Code as your external debugger
      by setting the following environment variable:
  
        export OMNETPP_DEBUGGER_COMMAND="code --open-url \"vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/config?{request:'attach', pid:'%u'}\""
  
      Alternatively, you can specify the same value ("code --open-url ...")
      to the "debugger-attach-command" configuration option in omnetpp.ini.
  
    - Added LLDB pretty printers for various OMNeT++ types. They can be useful
      if you use LLDB-based external debuggers like XCode or VS Code. You should
      manually import them from the LLDB debugger console with the
  
        command script import <OMNETPP_ROOT>/python/omnetpp/lldb/formatters/omnetpp.py
  
      LLDB command.
  
  Envir:
  
    - Made the -q option more permissive: if -c is missing, assume "General"
  
    - Added the -e option (print value of the given configuration option)
  
  Qtenv:
  
    - Modernized look: Material-style SVG-based icons, HIDPI support, dark theme
      support.
  
    - New actions on the main toolbar: "Debug next event", "Debug on errors",
      "Show animation parameters". ("Load NED file" was removed from the toolbar
      as it was rarely needed, but it's still available from the menu.)
  
    - In the message/packet traffic view of the log inspector ("messages view"),
      simulation time is now formatted with digit grouping on.
  
    - The "Set Sending Time as Reference" option was added to the messages view
      context menu. This option makes it possible to set a reference time, and
      display all other times as a delta compared to it.
  
    - The "Allow Backward Arrows for Hops" option was added to the messages view
      context menu. This option turns on the use of backward arrows to ensure a
      consistent relative ordering of modules in the log. For example, if two
      modules A and B exchange messages, this option will cause the window to
      display them as "A-->B" and "A<--B", as opposed to the default "A-->B" and
      "B-->A". This sometimes makes the log easier to follow.
  
    - The view mode (grouped/flat/inheritance/children) in the object inspector
      used to be tied to the type (class) of the object displayed in the
      inspector. Since that resulted in too much mode switching while the user
      navigated the object tree, and the switching logic was not easily
      discoverable by the user, we removed the feature of per-type remembering of
      view modes. The view mode now only changes when the user explicitly
      switches in on the UI.
  
    - A lot of effort was made to refine packet animation, also with regard to
      the new "transmission updates" API. For example, the animation filter now
      affects deliveries as well, and transmissions on ideal channels are now
      shown as a full-length line. Transmission updates are drawn as "notches"
      on the message line.
  
    - Add error reporting to .qtenvrc accesses.
  
    - Countless small improvements and bug fixes.
  
  Analysis Tool:
  
    - Chart improvements, such as adding error bars to the Matplotlib-based
      bar chart, and adding confidence interval drawing to the Matplotlib-based
      scatter chart.
  
    - UI refinements, such as rearranging the menu items on the Browse Data page.
  
    - Improved how selection works in the table widget (Browse Data page).
  
    - Content assist improvements, mainly for the "Input" pages of chart dialogs.
  
    - Performance improvements, such as enabling vector data caching when pickling
      results, and memoizing the results of query methods.
  
    - Countless small improvements and bug fixes.
  
  
  OMNeT++ 6.0pre8 (April 2020)
  ----------------------------
  
  The main focus of improvements since pre7 was to improve the scalability of
  the new Analysis Tool. Indeed, the UI is now easily capable of dealing with
  at least several tens of thousands of result files, and a million result items
  (this was the input routinely used during the development). If you are unfamiliar
  with how and why the Analysis Tool was rewritten almost from scratch from
  the 4.x and 5.x version, read the previous (pre7) announcement.
  
  In the Sequence Chart Tool, support for horizontally finite sized events was
  added. This allows message sends and method calls in the same event to be
  separated along the y axis.
  
  Additional, relatively minor improvements in the core:
  
   - Added the "resultdir-subdivision" config option that causes result files to
     be distributed into a hierarchical subdirectory tree inside results/, using
     iteration variables as directory names. This is useful for simulation
     campaigns, because most file managers tend to struggle with directories
     containing more than a few thousand files.
  
   - opp_scavetool now accepts directory names as well ("load all result files
     recursively from there"), and also the "**" wildcard that can match several
     directory levels.
  
   - Added the "config-recording" config option, to control the of amount of
     config options to save in result files.
  
   - Added the "${datetimef}" config variable that is a better choice to be used
     as part of result file names than "${datetime}"
  
  Stay tuned.
  
  
  OMNeT++ 6.0pre7 (March 2020)
  ----------------------------
  
  This is a preview of the upcoming OMNeT++ 6.0 release. Work is still ongoing in
  several areas, especially on the new Analysis Tool, the Sequence Chart Tool,
  and Qtenv.
  
  The following list is a small subset of the changes since OMNeT++ 5.6. Until we
  get our change logs up to date, we suggest that you browse the public OMNeT++
  repository on GitHub for more information.
  
  Core:
  
    - Introduced structured NED parameters using JSON like syntax.
  
  IDE:
  
    - The Analysis Tool in the IDE has been rewritten, using a new approach.
      The number one goals were to allow ARBITRARY computations to be performed
      on the data, VISUALIZE the result in the most appropriate form chosen from
      a multitude of chart/plot types, and produce PUBLICATION QUALITY output.
      Additional goals were an intuitive user interface that makes straightforward
      tasks easy and convenient, scalability that allows the processing of
      a large amount of simulation results inside the IDE, and facilities
      to make (most of) the UI's functionality available on the command line
      as well.
  
      The key technologies the new Analysis Tool employs are Python, NumPy,
      Pandas, and Matplotlib. The use of Python and Pandas gives you access to
      advanced data manipulation and analysis capabilities, while Matplotlib
      offers dozens of plot types out of the box, endless customizations, and
      proven high-quality output. A large effort was made to properly integrate
      these technologies into the IDE, so that using the Analysis Tool provides
      a superior user experience, and brings the power of Python close to users
      without necessarily requiring them to actually write code in Python.
  
      Common charting tasks are accessible with a few mouse clicks, via
      predefined Chart Templates that can be configured using dialogs.
      The heart of all Chart Templates is Python code that performs all of the
      computation and plotting. The Python code behind a chart can be viewed
      and freely edited using an integrated language-aware editor. Matplotlib
      plots appear inside the Analysis Tool's UI, and they are live (i.e. not just
      images): zooming, panning, and interacting with possible embedded controls
      in the plot all work seamlessly. IDE-native plots can also be chosen
      as an alternative to Matplotlib, as they provide increased scalability at
      the cost of being less flexible and featureful.
  
      The OMNeT++ Python API for querying (and to a lesser extent, transforming
      and plotting) simulation results is available as a Python package for use
      in Python scripts outside the IDE. There is also a command-line tool
      (opp_charttool) that can "run" Analysis (anf) files e.g. for image export.
      opp_charttool can be integrated e.g. into the build process of a paper
      written in LaTeX.
  
    - Updated NED documentation generator with command line support (opp_neddoc).
      The documentation generator now allows you to inject your own documentation
      fragments (possibly generated by 3rd-party tools) at various points in the
      documentation.
  
  Samples:
  
    - Added a new sample (pythoncharts) that contains the documentation,
      and some sample analysis files for the new Python-based plotting,
      using the data from the resultfiles sample.
  
    - Added a new sample (openstreetmap) that displays a city map, with
      some animated car traffic on it. Map data comes from an OSM file
      exported from openstreetmap.org.
  
    - A new sample (petrinets) demonstrating how to implement stochastic
      Petri nets, a well-known formalism for the description of distributed
      systems.
  
  The following is a more complete list of changes done in the 6.0 development
  branch up to 6.0pre7. Note that this section was not part of the 6.0pre7
  release notes, it was added retroactively around 6.0pre13.
  
  Core:
  
    - Removed obsolete/deprecated classes and methods. A partial list:
      cVarHistogram, cLegacyHistogram, cLongHistogram, cDoubleHistogram,
      cWeightedStdDev, cDensityEstBase;  detailedInfo() method; timeval_*()
      functions; cHistogram methods setRangeAuto(), setRangeAutoLower(),
      setRangeAutoUpper(), setNumCells(), setCellSize(); operator() of iterator
      classes in cArray/cModule/cQueue; cFigure/cCanvas deprecated methods
      addFigureAbove() and addFigureBelow(); many cAbstractHistogram
      (ex-cDensityEstBase) methods, etc. See doc/API-changes.txt for more info.
  
    - Instead of the removed timeval_*() methods, use opp_get_monotonic_clock_usecs()
      or opp_get_monotonic_clock_nsecs(), and perform the arithmetic in int64_t.
  
    - cMatchExpression: Syntax now accepts the 'field=~pattern' syntax too, as
      alternative to 'field(pattern)'.
  
    - Folders can now be excluded when loading NED files. Exclusions can now be
      specified programmatically as an extra argument to cSimulation::loadNedSourceFolder().
      Exclusions can be specified to simulation programs using the -x option or in
      the OMNETPP_NED_EXCLUSION_PATH environment variable (which is renamed to
      OMNETPP_NED_PACKAGE_EXCLUSIONS in a later 6.0 prerelease).
  
    - intpar_t was renamed to intval_t, and uintval_t was added. Both are
      guaranteed to be at least 64 bits wide.
  
    - Signal listeners changed to use intval_t/uintval_t instead of long/unsigned
      long. This change was necessary because long is only 32 bits wide on Windows.
      This affects methods of cListener and subclasses like cResultFilter and
      cResultRecorder.
  
    - WITH_OMNETPP4x_LISTENER_SUPPORT was removed.
  
    - Emitting nullptr as a string (const char* overload of emit()) is disallowed.
      The reason is that nullptr cannot be represented in std::string, which
      causes problems e.g. in result filters and recorders.
  
    - cDynamicExpression has been reimplemented using the new internal Expression
      class, and support for user-defined variables, members, methods, and
      functions was added. As a consequence, the public interface of the class
      has significantly changed as well.
  
    - cClassDescriptor: Use exception instead of returning false for
      indicating error. The return type of the following method changed
      from void to bool: setFieldValueAsString(), setFieldArraySize(),
      setFieldStructValuePointer().
  
    - cClassDescriptor: Added support for setting pointer members and array
      sizes via class descriptors. New methods: setFieldArraySize(),
      setFieldStructValuePointer().
  
    - Optimized cModule::ChannelIterator by letting cModule maintain a linked
      list of channels (cChannel), so that ChannelIterator doesn't have to search
      through the whole compound module to find them.
  
    - New inifile variables: ${iterationvarsd}, ${datetimef}
  
    - cDefaultList was renamed to cDefaultOwner (later it will be further
      renamed to cSoftOwner).
  
    - Added two new model change notifications: cPostModuleBuildNotification,
      cPostComponentInitializeNotification.
  
    - cNedValue renamed to cValue (compatibility typedef added), because it is
      now used as generic value by cExpression, i.e. is not specific to NED.
  
    - NED functions can now be defined with the alternative signature:
  
          cValue f(cExpression::Context *context, cValue argv[], int argc)
  
      in addition to the existing signature
  
          cValue f(cComponent *contextComponent, cValue argv[], int argc)
  
      The cExpression::Context argument allows one to access the context
      component, and also the directory where the ini file entry or the
      NED file containing the expression occurred (baseDirectory).
      Define_NED_Function() accepts both signatures. The base directory
      is useful for functions like xmldoc() that want to access files
      relative to the location of the NED expression.
  
    - cPar: added support for object parameters. New type constant: OBJECT;
      New methods: setObjectValue(), objectValue(), operator=(cObject*),
      operator cObject*.
  
    - Added cValueArray and cValueMap classes for representing JSON data in
      NED expressions.
  
    - Under the hood, all expression parsing and evaluation tasks now use
      a new generic extensible expression evaluator framework. It is used for NED
      expressions, object matching, scenario constraint, statistics recording,
      result selection in the Simulation IDE and in opp_scavetool, in
      cDynamicExpression and cMatchExpression, etc. In the new framework,
      expression parsing and the translation of the AST to an evaluator tree are
      done in separate steps, which makes the library very versatile. Evaluators
      include support for shortcutting logical and conditional operators, constant
      folding, and an 'undefined' value (anything involving 'undefined' will evaluate
      to 'undefined').
  
      NOTE: The fact that logical operators and inline-if are now shortcutting may
      change the fingerprint of some simulations, due to consuming fewer random
      numbers during expression evaluation.
  
    - cConfiguration: Removed getParameterKeyValuePairs(). Instead,
      getKeyValuePairs() made smarter with an extra flags parameter
      to be able to handle the various use cases.
  
    - Added cFigure::hashGeometry().
  
    - Added a few new cEnvir methods: recordComponentType(), recordParameter(),
      getConnectionLine().
  
    - Many other smaller-scale changes.
  
  NED:
  
    - NED grammar: Added "object" as parameter type. Parameters of this type may
      hold objects subclassed from cOwnedObject that they can take ownership of.
  
    - Support @class() property on NED parameters of type "object". Syntax:
      @class(classname) or @class(classname?). The property specifies that the
      parameter should only accept objects of the given type and its subclasses.
      The referenced class must be registered via Register_Class() or
      Register_Abstract_Class(). Parameters declared without the question mark in
      @class() don't accept nullptr as value, while the ones with question mark
      do.
  
    - NED grammar: Extended to accept JSON-line expressions. Added
      support for JSON object and array notation, and the nullptr keyword.
  
      Array syntax: [ expr, expr, ... ]
      Object syntax: optional_name { key1: value1, key2: value2, ... }
  
      Tagged maps (object syntax a map with an in front) are an extension to JSON
      which is going to be useful later. The implementation of JSON values and
      object parameters is sketchy in this release, they are refined in later
      prereleases.
  
    - NED grammar: Made operator precedence more similar to C/C++.
      Relational operators (==, !=, <, <=, >, >=) used to be on the same
      precedence level; now == and != have lower precedence than the rest.
  
    - NED grammar: Added the '=~' (match) and '<=>' (comparison, a.k.a.
      "spaceship") operators, the 'undefined' keyword, and bool() as
      conversion function.
  
    - String constants are now accepted with apostrophes too. This makes it
      possible to write quotation marks in strings without the need to escape
      them.
  
    - For quantities (numbers with measurement units), the rules have changed
      slightly. When specifying quantities with multiple terms, a minus sign is
      only accepted at the front, to reduce the chance of confusion in arithmetic
      expressions. I.e. "-5s100ms" is valid as a quantity string (and means
      -5.1s), but "5s-100ms" is no longer.
  
      Also, the plain "0" constant is no longer accepted at places where a
      quantity with a measurement unit is expected. Reason: it was confusing when
      the expected unit was dB or dBm. E.g. in omnetpp.ini, should "**.power = 0"
      be interpreted as 0W or 0dBm?
  
    - xmldoc() now interprets the file name as relative to the directory the
      expression comes from. When xmldoc() occurs in an included ini file,
      the file name is now interpreted as relative to the directory containing
      the included ini file (as opposed to being relative to the main ini file
      or the working directory.) If xmldoc() occurs in a NED file, the file name
      is relative to the directory where that NED file was loaded from.
  
    - Added support for embedding NED files into a binary (an executable or
      library). opp_nedtool's "cpp" command allows you to generate C++ code that
      contains the content of NED files as string constants, which can
      then be compiled into the simulation binary. When the simulation program is
      started, these embedded NED files will be loaded automatically, and the
      original NED files will no longer be needed for running simulations.
      Optional garbling, which prevents NED source code from being directly
      readable inside the compiled binaries, is also available. A makefrag file
      can be used to integrate the NED-to-C++ translation into the build process.
      To see an example makefrag file, view the 'makefrag' help topic in opp_nedtool.
  
    - Changed how NED loading works with regard to package.ned files.
      package.ned files were looked up in the ancestor *folders*, not in
      ancestor *packages* as in the NED spec. This also fixes issues with NED
      embedding when it's mixed with dynamic NED loading (such as class lookup
      errors in inet/test/fingerprint/ethernet-*.csv when INET is build with
      embedding the NED files under src/). As part of this change, we only allow
      one package.ned per package (even if that package occurs over several distinct
      source trees).
  
  MSG:
  
    - Added @custom field property. It causes the field to only appear in
      descriptors, but no code is generated for it at all. One can inject the
      code that implements the field (data member, getter, setter, etc.) via
      targeted cplusplus blocks.
  
    - Allow injecting code into almost any of the generated methods, via
      targeted cplusplus blocks. Specify <classname>::<methodname> as target for
      the cplusplus block. Supported methods include the constructor, copy
      constructor (use "Foo&" as name), destructor, operator=, copy(),
      parsimPack(), parsimUnpack(), etc., and the per-field generated methods
      (setter, getter, etc.).
  
    - Added the syntax and infrastructure for method-targeted cplusplus
      blocks. Syntax: cplusplus <target> {{ <body> }}.
  
    - Use the "=delete" syntax of C++11 in the generated code.
  
    - Struct fields are now initialized inline, not via a constructor.
  
    - Added support for setting pointer members and array sizes via class
      descriptors. (cClassDescriptor had no facility for that.)
      This involves adding two methods to cClassDescriptor (setFieldArraySize()
      and setFieldStructValuePointer()), and support for the @resizable() and
      @replaceable field attributes that tell the message compiler to generate
      the respective code in the class.
  
    - cMatchExpression: The  'field =~ pattern' syntax replaces 'field(pattern)'.
      Also removed the implicit OR syntax. The old syntaxes looked confusing, and
      made it different to tell apart concise notation from expression-style notation.
  
  Runtime:
  
    - Added support for result directory subdivision: the resultdir-subdivision=
      <bool> configuration option and the ${iterationvarsd} variable. The
      motivation is that the performance of various file managers (including
      Eclipse's Project Explorer) tends to be degrade severely if there more than
      a few thousand files in single directory. In OMNeT++, this problem may occur
      when a parameter study produces a large number many result files. The common
      workaround is to "hash" the files into a subdirectory tree. (For example,
      git also uses this technique to store the contents of .git/objects dir).
  
      In OMNeT++, such feature can be turned on by setting resultdir-subdivision=
      true in the configuration. Since it is natural to use the iteration
      variables to define the directory hierarchy, directory subdivision makes
      used of a new ${iterationvarsd} configuration variable. This variable is
      similar to ${iterationvarsf} but it contains slashes instead of commas,
      which makes it suitable for creating a directory tree. Enabling directory
      subdivision will cause "/${configname}/${iterationvarsd}" to be appended to
      the name of the results directory (see result-dir config option), causing
      result files to be created in a subdirectory tree under the results
      directory.
  
      If you want to set up the directory hierarchy in a different way, you can
      do so by setting the results-dir config option and appending stuff to the
      value. E.g.: results-dir = "results/${repetition}"
  
    - NED path handling improvements:
        - The NEDPATH environment variable has been renamed to OMNETPP_NED_PATH,
          but the old one is still recognized for backward compatibility.
        - Multiple -n options are now accepted. Also, the NEDPATH environment
          variable used to be ignored when a -n option was present, no longer so.
        - Excluding directories from NED file loading has been implemented. NED
          exclusions can be specified in multiple ways: -x <nedexclusionpath>
          command-line option, OMNETPP_NED_EXCLUSION_PATH environment variable,
          ned-exclusion-path= config option.
  
    - Image path handling improvements:
        - The -i <imgpath> option command-line option has been added. It may
          occur multiple times. The image path is now defined jointly by the
          OMNETPP_IMAGE_PATH environment variable, -i <imgpath> command-line
          options, and the image-path config option.
        - "./bitmaps" was removed from default image path (it was virtually
          unused).
        - The default value, "./images" has been moved into the image-path
          config option.
  
    - Several global config options change to be per-run: scheduler-class,
      debug-on-errors, print-undisposed, fingerprintcalculator-class.
  
    - Accept expressions as value for (most) config options. For options that
      accept values both with and without quotes (types STRING, FILENAME,
      FILENAMES, PATH), a heuristic decides whether a string is to be taken
      literally or to be evaluated as an expression.
  
    - Allow parameter values to be specified on the command line. For example,
      --**.mss=512 is equivalent to inserting the **.mss=512 line near the
      top of the configuration in omnetpp.ini.
  
    - Do not complain about missing omnetpp.ini if a --network option is
      present.
  
    - Implemented "${datetimef}"
  
    - Added the "config-recording" configuration option, which controls
      the amount of configuration options to save into result files.
  
    - Allow recording actual module/channel parameter values into the output
      scalar file, via a new config option: **.param-recording=true/false. Note
      that parameters will be recorded as "parameter" result items, not as
      scalars. For volatile parameters, the expression itself will be recorded
      (e.g. "exponential(0.5)"), not any particular value drawn from it.
  
    - Updated documentation of the eventlog-message-pattern option: change
      "field(pattern)" syntax to "field=~pattern".
  
    - Added "%<" (trim preceding whitespace) for the list of accepted directives
      for log prefixes.
  
    - "-h resultfilters" and "-h resultrecorders" now print the descriptions of
      result filters and recorders as well.
  
    - The obsolete command-line options -x, -X, -g, and -G were removed.
  
    - In order to reduce OMNeT++'s external dependencies, we now use an embedded
      copy of Yxml as the default XML parser. Yxml (https://dev.yorhel.nl/yxml)
      is a small and fast SAX-style XML parser  with a liberal license.
  
      Support for using LibXML2 remained in place, but very few users will
      actually need it. Expat support has been removed. Note that no significant
      functionality is lost when Yxml is used instead of LibXML2. LibXML2 is only
      needed for Schema or DTD-based validation (and possibly, default value
      completion), which virtually no simulation models require. Also note that
      Yxml-based parsing scales much better than LibXML, both performance-wise and
      regarding memory usage.
  
    - The bundled SQLite sources were upgraded to version 3.30.1 (2019-10-10).
  
  Cmdenv:
  
    - Added the cmdenv-fake-gui=true/false option. Fake GUI means that
      refreshDisplay() is called periodically during simulation, in order to mimic
      the behavior of a graphical user interface like Qtenv. It is useful for
      testing simulation models with visualization using Cmdenv, e.g. in smoke or
      fingerprint tests.
  
  Qtenv:
  
    - Use space as digit separator by default in the main simulation time and
      event number displays.
  
    - Fix: Image loading did not obey the '-s' (silent) command-line option.
  
  Tkenv:
  
    - Tkenv has been removed. Use Qtenv for all simulations.
  
  Tools:
  
    - Added opp_neddoc, a tool that makes it possible to generate HTML
      documentation from NED files from the command line. opp_neddoc works by
      launching the IDE in headless mode.
  
    - opp_nedtool was rewritten for convenience and features. The main points
      are the following:
        - Removed msgc-related functionality, now it is really just about NED.
        - Command-line interface redesigned for better usability (subcommands,
          better help, etc.)
        - Added support for generating C++ source ("cpp" subcommand), for
          embedding NED files into an executable or library.
        - Added support for processing NED folders.
        - More convenient output (no *_n.ned, *_n.xml).
        - Removed obsolete @listfile and @@listfile support.
        - Fixed bugs in splitting NED files to one NED type per file.
  
    - opp_msgtool was rewritten in the style of opp_nedtool. Details:
        - Made --msg6 the default mode. (Note that --msg4 will be removed for the
          6.0 release.)
        - The command-line interface now uses subcommands. It is still compatible
          with earlier versions (if the subcommand is missing, it defaults to
          C++ code generation), only the rarely useful -T (type of next file)
          and -h (here) options have been removed.
        - Better help. A "builtindefs" help page has also been added, which
          prints the built-in declarations.
  
    - opp_scavetool had several improvements. A brief summary:
        - The tool now accepts directories as command-line arguments, too, and
          recursively loads scalar and vector files from them.
        - Command-line arguments may now contain double asterisk wildcards (**)
          in addition to normal wildcards (*,?). Double asterisks can match any
          number of directory levels. Example: results/**.vec matches all .vec
          files anywhere under the results/ directory. (When specifying wilcard
          arguments on the command line, be sure to quote them so that the shell
          does not expand them before opp_scavetool gets invoked.)
        - Added options to limit vector data by simulation time: --start-time
          <time>, --end-time <time>.
        - Accepts exporter options in the --<key>=<value> notation as well, not
          only with -x.
        - In filter expressions, run attributes now have to be referred to with
          the "runattr:" prefix. The "attr:" prefix now only matches result attributes.
        - In exporters, the way of representing histograms has slightly changed:
          underflow/overflow values are now saved separately instead of as
          underflow/overflow "bins". Thus, there's now one more bin edges than bin
          values.
        - The possibility to apply vector operations to vector results was removed
          from opp_scavetool and exporters. The recommended way of processing output
          vectors is with Python and NumPy.
        - The help subcommand was refined.
  
    - Added opp_charttool, a tool for "running" ANF files on the command line,
      e.g. for chart or data export.
  
    - opp_featuretool: Extensive refactoring as well as refinement of its
      operation and command-line options. In general, the tool has become more
      forgiving: a missing ".featurestates" file and extra/missing entries in it
      don't cause an error or even a message. Missing file and file entries are
      initialized with the default enablement state; extra entries are preserved
      (in the hope they'll be useful, e.g. after switching to a different topic
      branch. The content of the ".nedexclusions" file is now also automatically
      adjusted without stopping with an error. User-visible changes are the following:
        - Removed the "validate" and "repair" commands (all commands implicitly
          validate and repair now).
        - Better validation of the ".oppfeatures" file: Report detect duplicate
          feature IDs and unresolved feature dependencies.
        - Check for the existence of the C++ source root and NED folders.
        - Preserve unknown features in the ".featurestate" file instead of fail/warn
          about them. Reason: they often occur when switching between branches.
        - "isenabled -v" prints list of disabled features to stdout, not to stderr
        - Complain less about fixable problems.
        - Non-verbose operation by default.
        - Improved error/warning messages.
  
    - opp_makemake: The "makefrag" file is now included instead of copied
      into the generated makefile. Also, a "help" target has been added to the
      generated makefiles: typing "make help" now prints the list of accepted
      targets ("all", "clean", etc.) and user-settable makefile variables ("MODE",
      "V", "CFLAGS", etc.), complete with helpful descriptions and usage examples.
  
    - opp_test now prints PASS/FAIL/UNRESOLVED in color. The diagnostic output
      for failed tests was also improved: the tool now displays a colorized diff
      instead of simply printing the expected and the actual contents.
  
    - Use python3 in all scripts.
  
  Result file format changes:
  
    - There were a number of changes in the format of result files (.sca and
      .vec files), so the file format version has been bumped from 2 to 3. (The
      file format is recorded at the top of each result file in a "version" line.)
      The set of changes is relatively small; see details below.
  
    - Iteration variables are no longer saved as run attributes but in separate
      "itervar" lines, in order to be able to tell them apart with certainty.
  
    - "param" lines (which recorded parameter assignment entries in the
      configuration) have been replaced with the more general "config" lines.
      "config" lines record all configuration entries, not just parameter assignments.
  
    - In version 2, concrete parameter values (if requested) were recorded as
      scalars, whereas in version 3 they are recorded as a separate result item
      type, in "par" lines. This allows for recording of volatile parameters (as
      expressions) and non-numeric values as well.
  
    - Component NED type names are now recorded, as "typename" pseudo parameters.
  
    - The "sum" and "srqsum" fields of weighted statistics are no longer recorded,
      as they are irrelevant.
  
    - SQLite result files underwent a similar change in the database schema. Files
      in the old format are not understood. A brief summary of changes:
  
        - The "runParam" table was renamed to "runConfig", and its columns were
          also similarly renamed: "paramKey", "paramValue" and "paramOrder"
          became "configKey", "configValue" and "configOrder".
  
        - Iteration variables are in a new table "runItervar", with columns
          "runId", "itervarName" and "itervarValue".
  
        - Two new tables were added for representing the new result items type:
          "parameter" (with the columns "paramId", "runId", "moduleName",
          "paramName" and "paramValue"), and "paramAttr" (with the columns
          "paramId", "attrName" and "attrValue"). Note that the value is written
          in the syntax it would have to be written in a NED file or in
          omnetpp.ini, i.e. string constants include the quotation marks.
  
  Simulation IDE:
  
    - Analysis Tool rewrite in progress, see above.
  
    - Allow SVG export in the NED Editor and in the Sequence Chart Tool.
  
    - The NED documentation generator has been updated. Details:
  
        - Modern look for the generated pages (Material design).
  
        - Navigation tree revised.
  
        - It is now possible to specify excluded directories during documentation
          generation, in order to be able to exclude samples, showcases etc. that
          are not integral part of the documentation.
  
        - Now generates nedtags.xml/msgtags.xml file which is compatible with
          the doxytags.xml file generated by doxygen. This allows crosslinking to
          the ned documentation from a sphinx based documentation (using the
          doxy-link plugin)
  
        - Generate usage and inheritance diagrams ONLY if they are meaningful.
  
        - Use SVG files as the usage/inheritance diagram image. Removed map
          files as SVG already contains proper links.
  
        - Generate "Implementors" table for interfaces. The Implementors table
          includes indirect implementors as well.
  
        - Fix: Inheritance diagrams were missing in module interface pages,
          even if they had implementors. This bug made INET documentation much less
          useful.
